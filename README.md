## Design System

The UI follows a **Tesla-inspired layout structure** adapted for the tyre industry — light-first, minimal, and premium.

- **Primary color:** Okelco Orange `#f4511e`
- **Background:** `#f5f5f5`
- **Text:** `#171a20`
- **Buttons:** pill-shaped (`border-radius: 999px`)
- **Panels:** `border-radius: 22px`
- **Fonts:** SF Pro / system sans-serif stack

Full design system documentation is in [`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

---

## Status

Frontend-only implementation. Form submissions (contact, quote) use simulated state — no backend wiring yet. Cart and checkout flows are UI-complete pending API integration.
